(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It was very effective to copy the manual exactly as it said to do and then solve any problem that arised with trial and error. I also tried to not give up and ask for help if I needed it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was still limited by the fact that I had never used that code before and I made sure I did not give up but used all of my available rescources to complete the excercise without the teachers help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by working quicker so I can get more done and I will change some of the ways I complete the question, such as using logic instead of trial and error all the time </td>
