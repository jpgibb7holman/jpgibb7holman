  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using what we had learnt doing Codecademy and what the teacher had set as the question. For example, one of the questions was to make a joke and make the computer pause before delivering the punchline. This is how you would do it…

print ("What did the muffin say when the other muffin got hit by a car?")
import time
time.sleep (5)
print (“Oh crumbs!”)

This makes the computer say the joke, wait 5 seconds and then deliver the punchline. Although this is the way I did it, it is not the only way, and there are probably simpler ways t do it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by forgetting what I had learnt in Codecademy. I do not have a very good memory and have to revise stuff like this before I can call it off of the top of my head. The second and last question he asked was also tricky. In the end it was simple once I realised how to do it but it took me a while to actually realise.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to memorise what we are doing more, by taking notes and really paying attention when he was telling us the solution at the end. I will also try not to over complicate the question, which is what I did in the first question he asked us. I typed 4 lines of code when it could have been done in 3 lines.</td>
