# FIRST WEEK OF OUR NEW TEACHER (THIS YEAR)

So in our recent IT lesson, we went around in the rota and had our first lesson with our new teacher. With our old teacher we had been doing a lot of different things on Google Sheets (you would know this if you had read my previous blogs), but now we are starting to move into proper coding, using a certain type of coding language, known as Python3. We were using repl.it to write our code and see if it would work.

We had to use the code to have a conversation we would have when greeting someone new, such as "Hello, how are you?" and things like that. I used variables such so it it would be easier to type in, then I would use things like input and set that as resp1, meaning response 1.
