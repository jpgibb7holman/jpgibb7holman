**Starting to code the quizzes**

** **   Today in IT we started to code the quizzes we had made. You can see mine in a previous blog post, but of you do not want to have to go through all that effort, I will tell you what my quiz is about.

     The main question I had done was asking "What type of dog should you get?". There were 6 questions, such as “How active are you?”, “What would your ideal day be?” and “How intelligent would you say you are honestly?”. There would be four options for an answer, and each answer represented a different dog breed.

**EXAMPLE**

"How active are you?"

* I exercise every day - German Shepherd

* A few times a week - Yorkshire Terrier

* Once a week - Labrador

* Never - Pug

     Each question would be structured like this one, and whichever breed you got the most, would be the type of dog you should get.
