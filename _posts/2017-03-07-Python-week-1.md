    <td>There were guidelines to help us because we were not very familiar with python so we started the beginners course. Listening to Mr Keen was important as we did not know what to and the things he said were very important and useful.</td>

    <td>Some of the courses were quite hard but I tried not to look at the tips that were on offer and tried to do it myself. One in particular was very hard and took us all a while but we got through it in the end and got a badge :)
