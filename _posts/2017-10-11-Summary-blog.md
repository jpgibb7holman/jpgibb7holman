# SUMMARY BLOG 

    In our last lesson of Year 9 IT, we started coding with anagrams. The first tasks were very simple such as the shift cipher and all of them involved the =vlookup function.

    In our second last lesson we started to use the alphabet and shift cipher to encode and decode messages. We would decide what message to send and then encode it for the other person to recieve and try to decipher.

    We then found out how to add punctuation to the messages that we were sending, again using the =vlookup that we had used in previous code (encoding and decoding)
