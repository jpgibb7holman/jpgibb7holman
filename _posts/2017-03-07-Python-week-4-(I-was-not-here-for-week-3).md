    <td>I learnt by reading the background information on each exercise then reading the instructions on each exercise, then trying to complete each exercise based on what I had learned in previous exercises and the information and instructions to complete the task at hand.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by the harder exercises. They slowed me down so I could not do other exercises when I was stuck on those. When I was on those exercises, I had to ask the teacher once I had tried everything and had no idea what to do next.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
