Last Week 

     Today was our last week of IT this year, and we had a fun lesson. We went on to some online chatbots (online chatbots are things wher you go onto a website and type something into a bar, then they respond). Then we discussed what code they would have in them to make them work in such a way.

     There were lots of suggestions, but the main one (the one closest to the answer) was that when you type in certain words, they would act as key words or trigger words. This would cause the response by the bot.

     The most basic one we tried simply duplicated the first 3 words of each sentence. It would say "What is this junk?" followed by the first 3 words of the sentence you typed and then “Seriously?”
