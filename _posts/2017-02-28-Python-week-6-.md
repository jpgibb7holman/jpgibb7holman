    <td>I learnt by reading the basic infprmation that told us how we do what we would need to do, then reading the instructions and trying to complete the exercise with what I had previously learnt and what I had read in the information and occaisonly the tip if I got really stuck</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by the harder exercises, as they slowed me down a lot, and also I dont want to ask for help if I really don't know what to do. I would look at the tip, but if I still didnâ€™t understand what I was doing, it would be a while before I would allow myself to ask for help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to ask for help instead of just sitting there and waiting for a while before I asked. I will not just give ip straight away, but equally, I will not not ask for help if I really need it. I will try to get the right blend of both so I can do the maximum amount of exercises and further my knoweledge of the Pythin coding language.</td>
