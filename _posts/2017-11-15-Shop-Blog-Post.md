**Making a shop**

    In our last IT lesson, we learnt how to make a sort of till system for a shop we would make (a virtual shop). We would put some items and put in some code, so that we would be able to write the price of the item and then the quantity of the item. This would mean if you wanted, say, 4 pairs of socks, you would write in the quantity column 4, and the item column, socks. The code we used would then calculate the price of the item and put it all into one amount, which would be the total.
