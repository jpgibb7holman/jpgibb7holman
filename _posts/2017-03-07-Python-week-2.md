  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the example, then moving on to the instructions and trying to complete the exercise using what the examples and instructions told me. It does not just tell you exactly what to do though, you actually need to think so it is better than what we did with the FUZE boxes because those told you exactly what to do instead of giving you hints and making you use your brain</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When I got onto exercise 16, I was stuck for ages on it. I read the examples and instructions over and over again and even looked at the hint, but I still could not figure it out. I had to get some help from a friend to complete it and only then did I understand it. I had put the string in the wrong place and used the wrong method to link the string but it was very confusing </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to ask for help sooner instead of just sitting there and thinking round and round in circles, but I won't just give up at the first hurdle and ask for help straight away. I will balance it out so I ask for help when I am really stuck but not when I just started an exercise and haven't really thought about it.</td>
