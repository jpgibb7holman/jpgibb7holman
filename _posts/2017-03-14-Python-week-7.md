  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by the speed at which I worked. On some of the exercises I was quite slow and could have been faster, which would have meant I could have done more exercises in the same amount of time. It was only the harder ones that took me longer, as they involved a higher amount of work and were more complicated.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to work faster, so I am able to do more exercises and therefore being able to learn more and have a greater understanding of the code we are working on. I will also try to do the harder ones a tiny bit slower, so I really understand what I am doing.</td>
