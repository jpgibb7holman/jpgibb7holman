  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To learn, we would read the information telling us how to do what would need to do, and then we would read the instructions which told us what we would need to do. We would then apply what we have learned previously from previous exercises to complete the task at hand.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by the harder exercices, such as the Grand Finale level of Date and time. You had to figure out how to show the full date and time in the print box in the corner. It does not seem very hard right now, but it was really hard to figure out.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to complete the exercises faster so I can move on to and complete other and more difficult exercises further on in the course. I will also ask for help more instead of trying to figure it out when I was completely and utterly stuck.</td>
